## Mission: Escape the CDG Airport, and Get To My Hostel
I landed with no clue on how I would be gettng to my hostel room in 

## Step 1: Get to the passport checkpoint
While I waited in line to go through customs the girl and her friend who had complimented me when boarding told me that they were actually here for her friends' birthday, after which they promptly tried to rally the other tired travelers to sing happy birthday for her. It was quite awkward to be honest, but it brought some levity to the dreary atmosphere while we waited for the bus, and made me smile just a little. After a while the bus arrived to take us to the passport checkpoint.
## Step 2: Get past the passport checkpoint
In the line for the passport checkpoint, I struck up conversation with a young man. We started with the usual, what are you going to see, where are you from, etc... and that was when I learned he was also from Colorado! Such a small world. He was even on the same flight out of Colorado as I was, but I hadn't seen him up until that point, which was quite funny.
## Step 3: ???
After the passport checkpoint, I had no clue how the fuck I was going to get to my hostel. I had done a grand total of 50 minutes of research up to this point, so I had no idea what to do. I sat around for around 2 hours google searching how to get out of the airport and to my hotel, Google Maps was no help, it kept telling me to walk to a bus station that I couldn't get to on foot for the life of me. So I bought a sandwich and found an ATM to withdrawal 40 euros cash, because my mom said lots of eruope dosent take card, which is true outside the big cities, and you need a euro coin or two to access most public restrooms, also if you want to ride the bus without a ticket you need to hand over 2.50 euro cash, in France at least.
## Step 4: Now it makes sense
Eventually I learned that I needed to be at terminal 3 to access the main bus station. To get there I needed to follow signs for CDGVAL and get on the inter terminal CDGVAL route (for free) to reach the transit terminal with trains and the bus station outside. But I didn't know how to pay for the bus, yes I know, I'm a stupid American, but I had no clue how to pay for the bus, so I went to the bus information desk and asked the lady how to pay for the bus. This was my chance to test the days worth of Duolinguo I had been doing for french. So I asked her if she spoke english because I didnt know the french word for bus or ticket. She told me in as few english words as she could that I would need 2.50 cash or I could go back into the terminal to search for an automaited ticket machine. So I went inside and bought a lemon soda to get some change.

 which they will give you change for if you dont have exact change, which is not what the lady at the bus information desk told me, anyways, im getting ahead of myself,
