# Paris Run
## Wake up
I woke up after my friend and took a shower. Afterwards I found him already packed up in the hostel lobby enjoying an espresso. Upon his recommendation I ordered one, and it was pretty good. After that we walked to the bus stop which was just around the corner
## Get to Paris
In order to get to Paris we wanted to take the bus to a train station, then take the train into Paris. We didn't want to go back to the airport because we wanted to see something new. But then we got on the wrong bus and went back to the airport bus terminal anyway. So we got off and took the train into Paris. We got off at the first stop in Paris, which was *Gare du Nord*. 
## Stash the Bags
From there we walked to the hostel Rams (my friends) mom had recommended. It was totally run down with the buttons in the bathroom falling off and weird smells coming from the toilets. But it was a reasonable price, and it was right next to the metro. So we locked up our bags to more easily walk the city.
## Go see what the big deal is
So everyone always talks about how cool Paris is, the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, etc... So we decided to go see what the big deal was. We had an online reservation for the Louvre, but that wasn't for a few hours, so we decided to just walk the city and see what was cool. We were headed in the general direction of the Eiffel Tower, so we rented some street bikes with the *Tier* app. 
## Disaster
Mine was fine, although the solid tires made the bumpy streets a pain to ride on, but my friends bike refused to let him accelerate and would keep trying to stop him. It was impressive how long he kept up with me when he explained how it was behaving afterwards. We decided to walk around after we ditched the bikes before getting to the Eiffel Tower, and we went to an Ikea to charge my phone because it had died. I was thirsty and nobody in Paris will give you tap water, or at least *I* didn't know how to ask properly, so I ordered a lemon soda on the Ikea digital kiosk, and the kiosk talked me into also trying a soft serve ice cream.
