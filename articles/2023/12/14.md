# Paris Run
## Wake up
I woke up after my friend and took a shower. Afterwards I found him already packed up in the hostel lobby enjoying an espresso. Upon his recommendation I ordered one, and it was pretty good. After that we walked to the bus stop which was just around the corner
## Get to Paris
In order to get to Paris we wanted to take the bus to a train station, then take the train into Paris. We didn't want to go back to the airport because we wanted to see something new. But then we got on the wrong bus and went back to the airport bus terminal anyway. So we got off and took the train into Paris. We got off at the first stop in Paris, which was *Gare du Nord*. 
## Stash the Bags
From there we walked to the hostel Rams (my friends) mom had recommended. It was totally run down with the buttons in the bathroom falling off and weird smells coming from the toilets. But it was a reasonable price, and it was right next to the metro. So we locked up our bags to more easily walk the city.
## Go see what the big deal is
So everyone always talks about how cool Paris is, the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, etc... So we decided to go see what the big deal was. We had an online reservation for the Louvre, but that wasn't for a few hours, so we decided to just walk the city and see what was cool. We were headed in the general direction of the Eiffel Tower, so we rented some street bikes with the *Tier* app. 
## Disaster
Mine was fine, although the solid tires made the bumpy streets a pain to ride on, but my friends bike refused to let him accelerate and would keep trying to stop him. It was impressive how long he kept up with me when he explained how it was behaving afterwards. 
## Ikea Too Soon
We decided to walk around after we ditched the bikes before getting to the Eiffel Tower, and we went to an Ikea to charge my phone because it had died. I was thirsty and nobody in Paris will give you tap water, or at least *I* didn't know how to ask properly, so I ordered a lemon soda on the Ikea digital kiosk, and the kiosk talked me into also trying a soft serve ice cream. The machine gave me a recipt and I awaited my number to be called. One small problem though, I don't know the french numbers. After waiting for my order to show up for a few minuites (it was a simple order you will remmeber, a bottle of soda and an ice cream) I tried to ask the man at the counter about my recipt. "Do you speak english" I said in french. "No" he replied. "Shit" I though (in french). So I just pointed out my recipt number, 49, and he managed to say, "48" with great effort in english. I gave him a thumbs up and waited my turn. He then handed me my bottle and an empty ice cream cone and a coin. He said something I didnt understand. It took me a few minuites to realize that this was not infact a coin, but a token for the ice cream mechine. I put the cone in the icecream machine and hit the button and it dispensed a dissapointingly warm soft serve that dripped a little as it came out. I tasted it and it was an heafty serving of valinna mixed in with a bit of sugar. Not to my liking, but my companion, ever the contrarian, proclaimed his love for it after just two licks. But despite his love of the ice cream he was reluctant to trust ikea to make a good coffee. So after charging my phone enough to use if for a while, we decided to not loiter in the Ikea, lest we spoil our propensity for scandinavia before arriving there. 
## A striking coincidence
We walked down the block searching for a cafe and saw an enormous building. As we walked up to it we were approached by a strange lady with a clipboard. Through broken english she explained that she was collecting support for the deaf. She asked my friend to fill out a petition style paper. While he did this I asked her what the big building was and she replied, "Oh this is the Louvre". It seemed that fate had brought us here. After my compatriot finished filling out the paper the woman informed us that they were collecting donations and the last part of the form was to give a donation. My friend tried to hand over a 2euro coin, and the woman tried to insist that the minimum donation was 10euro. My compatriot was confused so we simply walked away. (I'm prety sure this was just a scam lol)
