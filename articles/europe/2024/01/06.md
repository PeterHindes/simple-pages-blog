# Exploring Copenhagen
## Make A Plan
I woke up at like 1pm feeling much better than I had been for the last week. I decided I should go see the little mermaid statue because my friend from home recommended it. But first I needed some food. Also, I wanted to see the office of *Playdead* since I am considering applying to work there.
## First Stop, The *Playdead* office
I decided to visit the *Playdead* office first because it was the closest. I did find the buzzer on the door opened to the stairs I presume lead up to their offices, but seeing as it was a Saturday and I hadn't rehearsed my pitch I decided not to try getting in.
## Grocery Store
I stopped at a grocery store and got some bread, meat, and cheese for sandwiches and a bottle of strawberry yogurt drink. A good meal and a day and a half worth of food for just $10 in the city center.
## Copenhagen University
I was curious about the university scene, so I tried to find it. What I discovered is that it was spread out all over the city. Later I spoke with a student who was working at the royal library (the stop after next) and she told me that they were all doing exams right now, so classes were not running. From what I had seen they looked prey much closed, but I only went to two of the buildings. I also learned that apparently the Engineering/Technical university was not near the city center and is sort of a different university.
## The Little Mermaid Statue
I went and saw the statue, it was kind of boring and cold. It was a nice view, but I think the history is more interesting than the actual thing. I did see several people go down close to it to get a photo next to the statue. I was worried they would slip due to the ice (which you can see in the picture), but luckily none of them did.

## The Military Base next to The Little Mermaid
I went here on the recommendation of some girls I met at the hostel on the way up. I didn't really see the appeal. There might have been some building I didn't go into with some displays, but I wasn't going to hang around to find it because their bathroom was closed, and I had to go. So I decided to go to the Royal Library because it had a cool logo on Google Maps and I wanted to seem like an intellectual by visiting it. 
## The Royal Library
This was probably the highlight of my stay in Copenhagen. The library was beautiful from the outside and, while I did only see the first floor where the caf√© is located, the inside had an atmosphere of cheerful professionalism. I walked up to the cashier in the little merch shop they have next to the entrance, and asked about the signs for the games exhibit. She told me I needed a ticket, but for students it was much cheaper, around $4. Lucky me they also accept international students for that promotion.
### The Video Games Exhibit
They had an awesome exhibit on games made in Denmark. Some of which I didnt even know were from Denmark. They of course featured *Inside* and *Limbo* by *Playdead*, but they also had *Subway Surfers* and *Hitman* along with some other indie titles which I had no idea were from Denmark, probably because I had never bothered to check. I grabbed a few recommendations from the featured indie titles on the walls and I'm looking forwards to trying them out. A girl who I talked to at the exhibit recommended *A Hat In Time* (one of the featured titles), and they had a demo running of *What The Bat*, a quirky joke game in which you have to do *everyday* tasks, but your hands are baseball bats. Unfortunately for the visitors of the exhibit *What The Bat* was the only playable game on display. They made the bizarre choice to have all the other games presented with only video clips of a Danish speaking narrator playing the games.
### The Photography Exhibit
Little did I know that the ticket also included a fascinating exhibition of portrait photography and its history through a Danish perspective.
