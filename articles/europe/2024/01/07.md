# The Trip To Amsterdam
## A Late Start
I woke up a little late, and completely unpacked. But hostel beds being what they are, I needed a shower regardless. So I tried to be as fast as possible. But when I got out I only had 10 minutes until the scheduled departure. Then I checked the destination, Hamburg *Germany*, I was immediately relived as all German trains are always late. I still had to run (with all my gear on my back, in winter boots) all the way to the train station, but I arrived with 5 minutes to spare as the train had been replaced due to issues with the original, just as expected.
