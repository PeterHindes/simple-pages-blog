# Paris Run
## Wake up
I woke up after my friend and took a shower. Afterwards I found him already packed up in the hostel lobby enjoying an espresso. Upon his recommendation I ordered one, and it was pretty good. After that we walked to the bus stop which was just around the corner
## Get to Paris
In order to get to Paris we wanted to take the bus to a train station, then take the train into Paris. We didn't want to go back to the airport because we wanted to see something new. But then we got on the wrong bus and went back to the airport bus terminal anyway. So we got off and took the train into Paris. We got off at the first stop in Paris, which was *Gare du Nord*. 
## Stash the Bags
From there we walked to the hostel Rams (my friends) mom had recommended. It was totally run down with the buttons in the bathroom falling off and weird smells coming from the toilets. But it was a reasonable price, and it was right next to the metro. So we locked up our bags to more easily walk the city.
## Go see what the big deal is
So everyone always talks about how cool Paris is, the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, etc... So we decided to go see what the big deal was. We had an online reservation for the Louvre, but that wasn't for a few hours, so we decided to just walk the city and see what was cool. We were headed in the general direction of the Eiffel Tower, so we rented some street bikes with the *Tier* app. 
## Disaster
Mine was fine, although the solid tires made the bumpy streets a pain to ride on, but my friends bike refused to let him accelerate and would keep trying to stop him. It was impressive how long he kept up with me when he explained how it was behaving afterwards. 
## Ikea Too Soon
We decided to walk around after we ditched the bikes before getting to the Eiffel Tower, and we went to an Ikea to charge my phone because it had died. I was thirsty and nobody in Paris will give you tap water, or at least *I* didn't know how to ask properly, so I ordered a lemon soda on the Ikea digital kiosk, and the kiosk talked me into also trying a soft serve ice cream. The machine gave me a recipt and I awaited my number to be called. One small problem though, I don't know the french numbers. After waiting for my order to show up for a few minuites (it was a simple order you will remmeber, a bottle of soda and an ice cream) I tried to ask the man at the counter about my recipt. "Do you speak english" I said in french. "No" he replied. "Shit" I though (in french). So I just pointed out my recipt number, 49, and he managed to say, "48" with great effort in english. I gave him a thumbs up and waited my turn. He then handed me my bottle and an empty ice cream cone and a coin. He said something I didnt understand. It took me a few minuites to realize that this was not infact a coin, but a token for the ice cream mechine. I put the cone in the icecream machine and hit the button and it dispensed a dissapointingly warm soft serve that dripped a little as it came out. I tasted it and it was an heafty serving of valinna mixed in with a bit of sugar. Not to my liking, but my companion, ever the contrarian, proclaimed his love for it after just two licks. But despite his love of the ice cream he was reluctant to trust ikea to make a good coffee. So after charging my phone enough to use if for a while, we decided to not loiter in the Ikea, lest we spoil our propensity for scandinavia before arriving there. 
## A striking coincidence
We walked down the block searching for a cafe and saw an enormous building. As we walked up to it we were approached by a strange lady with a clipboard. Through broken english she explained that she was collecting support for the deaf. She asked my friend to fill out a petition style paper. While he did this I asked her what the big building was and she replied, "Oh this is the Louvre". It seemed that fate had brought us here. After my compatriot finished filling out the paper the woman informed us that they were collecting donations and the last part of the form was to give a donation. My friend tried to hand over a 2euro coin, and the woman tried to insist that the minimum donation was 10euro. My compatriot was confused so we simply walked away. (I'm prety sure this was just a scam lol)
## The Caf√©
We had a very charismatic waiter at the cafe, he was quite the character. We ordered mochas and they came with a whole mountain of wiped cream. They were so rich that I had to wash it down with water. The waiter told me how to ask for tap water in french. Overall it was quite fun. Afterwards we walked arround to kill some more time then headed towards the front of the Louvre.
## The Louvre
We got in with no problems. But once we were past security we ran into a little confusion. You see the Louvre website says that it is free for people under 24, and we were both under 24. However that is only for EU residents, which was not mentioned on the website to my memory. So we walked up to the entrance and the lady asked to see our proof of id. THen she told us that we had to go buy a ticket which was quite embarrassing. We both had to go pay 15euros, and the automated ticket machines were acting up so it took us a while to find a working one. We checked out the Louvre and it was the Louvre so that was that. We got some cool pictures then headed out.

## The Eiffel Tower
We decided to head to see the Eifel tower by rending some bikes from the Lime app. Once we got there we saw how busy the underside was, it seemed more trouble than it would be worth to try to get up it wihtout a reservation so we just got creps in the park. They were surprisingly cheap for being right next to the eifel tower, like 3 USD.

## The way back
So to get back to the hostel we decide to take the metro instead of the bikes as it seems it will be cheaper. Ram totaly messes up buyinhg the tickets and gets so upset he decides to walk all the way back which will take hime an hour or so. I already have my ticket so I just hop on. But halfway through my phone dies and as such I get off for my transfer a stop early. Confused as to why there is no other train to get on I go above ground and out of despartation decide to go the the restraunt ont he corner of the street. The very kindly let me charge my phone. But this place is expensive, the only thing I can afford here is a crepe, which is 6 euro! And to top it all off they offer me water and then bring a bottle which they charge me an ectra 5euro for! Absolutley rediculous. Well I do manage to get my phone charged and get back on the metro, but it takes me just as long as Ram to get back to the hostel. We got a good laugh out of that before heading to bed.
