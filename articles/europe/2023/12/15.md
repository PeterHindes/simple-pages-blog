# A break from the city
## The train
We decided to check out more of the countryside after falling in love with the small town asthetic on the first day of the trip. So I scoped out the nearest forest and google mapsed the public transit out there. We didnt know that you needed to buy a diffrent ticket for the trains. After taking the metro using the t-tickets, we assume they work on any transit within france. Somehow the train turnstyle lets us on with just the t-ticket, so we ride it there, but it wount let us out on the other end, and we have to go talk to the help desk. They sell us the return tickets and we head to the bus station to hop over to the edge of town.
